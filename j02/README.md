## What is a stream deck? 

I have a pretty time consuming job, it's not difficult but I have to **stay aware** of my open positions (stocks purchased throughout day.) from 6am to 1pm. Im also a college student which means I have to attend zoom classes throughout my work day; making each morning a bit more stressful. However, thanks to the Stream Deck I am now actively paying attention in my classes while also being updated with the realtime price of my open positions. It truly is quite **efficient** with my time for me since I only need to look at my stream deck to know the price the stock is trading at currently. While before I was very in-efficient, I had the zoom meetings cover half of my screen while the other half was my open positions. Truthfully I always tended to pay attention more to my open positions than the zoom class.

Setting it up was no hassle. The User Interface the stream deck application has it quite **learnable**.
