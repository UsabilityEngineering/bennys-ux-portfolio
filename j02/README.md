## What is a stream deck? 

I have a pretty time consuming job, it's not difficult but I have to *stay aware* of my open positions (stocks purchased throughout day.) from 6am to 1pm. Im also a college student which means I have to attend zoom classes throughout my work day; making each morning a bit more stressful. However, thanks to the Stream Deck I am now actively paying attention in my classes while also being updated with the realtime price of my open positions(F1). It truly is quite **efficient** with my time for me since I only need to look at my stream deck to know the price the stock is trading at currently. While before I was very in-efficient, I had the zoom meetings cover half of my screen while the other half was my open positions. Truthfully I always tended to pay attention more to my open positions than the zoom class.

About now is when you're asking, what even is a 'stream deck'? It's quite simple as you can see above, it's just 15 LCD buttons. Yup that's it. These 15 keys act as individual inputs or commands for your computer.

Setting it up was no hassle. The User Interface the stream deck application has is quite **learnable**(F2). Simply drag the action you want (from the right hand side of the screen) into one of the 15 keys you want, input any extra additions you want with it on the bottom of the UI and that's it.  The **usefulness** with this product is not limited at all; if you are quite savvy with APIs you can easily add one onto the stream deck app and make it do anything you want it to. 
Using this stream deck is very **satisfying** as I simply have to touch a couple buttons and I have all my brokers open in a browser window along with my Blackboard and gmail in literally a second(F3). Every morning I turn on my computer, press a couple buttons and I am instantly ready to accomplish what is needed.
