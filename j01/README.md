## Experiencing a new ergonomic keyboard.

Recently I decided I needed a new keyboard since the old one I used was taking too much space on my tiny desk. My goal was to find keyboards that allow for more desk space since I have no space for note taking. Then I came across a new world of keyboards, turns out there are keyboards called 60% keyboards. Apparently these 60% keyboards mean that they only are 60% the size compared to a regular keyboard. Turns out that was exactly what I was looking for.

I came across this Dygma Raise Split Keyboard [F1] and I am so fortunate I encountered this keyboard. Each key pressed is very **satisfying**. I believe the reason why each key feels satisfying to press is due to the choice of key switches it comes with. Key switches are what allow for the key to be interpreted as being pressed, there are many different types of key switches. The best part about this keyboard is that you are able to split the keyboard in half so your shoulders and wrist have reduced stress on them.[F2] Instead of the keyboard having one long button for our thumb it splits up that space bar into 8 customizable keys. I have never been more **effective** with a keyboard than this one with those 8 extra thumb keys. You might be asking how are those extra thumb keys effective? 


Since each individual key can be switched to whatever action, I made one of the keys backspace and another enter. So now I don't even need to move my right hand whenever I need to delete or hit enter. I thought it would take a couple days to get used to but the complete opposite happened! It was a very **memorable** layout I configured for myself.[F3] Memorable since, I tend to mistype very often but now my delete is where my left hand rests making it memorable.This is definitely one of the best products I have ever came across. On the next iteration of this product, an improvement would be to tent the keyboard on a slant while its split to allow for even greater natural posture while typing.
