## Experiencing a new ergonomic keyboard.

Recently I decided I needed a new keyboard since the old one I used was taking too much space on my tiny desk. My goal was to find 60% keyboards since I need more desk space for note taking.

I came across this Dygma Raise Split Keyboard and I am so fortunate I encountered this keyboard. Each key pressed is very **satisfying**. The best part about this keyboard is that you are able to split the keyboard in half so your shoulders and wrist have reduced stress on them. Instead of the keyboard having one long button for our thumb it splits up that space bar into 8 customizable keys. I have never been more **effective** with a keyboard than this one with those 8 extra keys. I thought it would take a couple days to get used to but the complete opposite happened! It was a very **memorable** layout I configured for myself. This is definitely one of the best products I have ever came across. On the next iteration of this product, an improvement would be to tent the keyboard on a slant while its split to allow for even greater natural posture while typing. 

## Definitions:

**satisfying** -> giving fulfillment or the pleasure associated with this


**effective** -> successful in producing a desired or intended result


**memorable** -> worth remembering or easily remembered, especially because of being special or unusual
