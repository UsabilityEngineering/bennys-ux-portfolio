## Experiencing a new ergonomic keyboard.

Recently I decided I needed a new keyboard since the old one I used was taking too much space on my tiny desk. My goal was to find 60% keyboards since I need more desk space for note taking.

I came across this Dygma Raise Split Keyboard and I am so fortunate I encountered this keyboard. Each key pressed is very **satisfying**. The best part about this keyboard is that you are able to split the keyboard in half so your shoulders and wrist have reduced stress on them. Instead of the keyboard having one long button for our thumb it splits up that space bar into 8 customizable keys.
